# JavaScript Calculator

Project 4 from freeCodeCamp.

This project is built using React, HTML, CSS, RegExp & CSS Grid .

### Project Objectives:

Given basic HTML and CSS files, use front end library React to create a javascript calculator which utilizes immediate logic and output calculation result.

1. At any time, pressing clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to the initial state.

2. The input values and formula are visible, and it is not allowed that the input value starts with multiple zeros.

3. Any operation (+-\*/) is able to work. If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign).

4. When the decimal element is clicked, a . appends to the currently displayed value; two . in one number is not accepted.

5. Pressing an operator immediately following = will start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.
